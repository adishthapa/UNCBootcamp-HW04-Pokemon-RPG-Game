This is a simple RPG Game based on the popular franchise called <strong>Pokemon.</strong>

At the start of the game, the player will be given the option to choose one of the four Pokemons shown in the screen.

Afterwards, it is their goal to defeat the rest of the remaining Pokemons.

The player can win no matter what Pokemon they choose, as long as they use strategy to play.

The Pokemons have three vital stats: Health Points, Attack Points and Counter Attack Points.

The Health Points determines the amount of damage the Pokemon can take. The Attack Points determines the amount of damage the Pokemon can inflict and the Counter Attack Points determines thhe amount of damage the Pokemon can return when attacked.

Good luck!
